# Text-Based Adventure Game (C++)

## Project Overview
This project is a **text-based adventure video game** developed in **C++**.  
The game features an **interactive narrative** where the player’s choices shape the story, combat outcomes, and overall progression. It combines classic text-based storytelling with modern features such as persistent settings, multiple save slots, and both keyboard and mouse input options.

The project aims to explore **object-oriented programming**, **basic engine architecture**, and **data persistence** within the context of game development.

## Main Features
- **Interactive Storyline:** Player decisions affect dialogue, outcomes, and endings.
- **Combat System:** Includes options for attacking, defending, and using items.
- **Persistent Settings:** Game options and preferences are saved between sessions.
- **Multiple Save Slots:** Players can manage multiple saved games.
- **Random Events:** Unpredictable scenarios that enhance replay value.
- **Keyboard & Mouse Input:** Support for both traditional text input and clickable buttons.
- **Modular Architecture:** Separated components for game logic, input, and state management.

## Architecture Overview
The project follows a modular design with clearly defined components:

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------------|
| **Core Engine** | Handles input, game logic, and text rendering. |
| **Game State Manager** | Manages transitions between menus, exploration, and combat. |
| **Save/Load System** | Provides multiple save slots and persistent settings. |
| **Event & Story System** | Handles branching narrative and random events. |

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++  
- **Libraries:**  
  - [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) or [SDL2](https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Tutorials) (for window management, input, and basic GUI)
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub
